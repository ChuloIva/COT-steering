    "response": "<think>This prompt is asking me to generate a realistic emotional response that captures the depressive emotional patterns someone might experience when feeling misunderstood by those close to them, from the perspective of a working professional.\n\nI need to create an authentic-sounding internal dialogue that represents how someone experiencing depression might think about feeling misunderstood. Then I'll provide an external response that reflects these thoughts.\n\nFor someone with depression who is a working professional feeling misunderstood, they might experience:\n- Feelings of isolation even when surrounded by others\n- A sense that they have to put on a \"mask\" or performance at work\n- Exhaustion from maintaining that facade\n- Frustration that loved ones don't see their struggle\n- Self-doubt about whether their feelings are valid\n- Worries about burdening others\n- Rumination about conversations that went poorly\n- A sense that explaining themselves is futile\n- Feeling trapped between professional expectations and personal struggles\n\nIn my response, I'll craft an internal dialogue that shows these thought patterns, including the rumination, negative self-talk, and emotional reasoning that often accompanies depression. I'll make sure to keep it realistic and thoughtful, avoiding any glamorization of depression.\n\nFor the final response, I'll create something that feels authentic to how someone might express these feelings, with the kind of weariness and resignation that often accompanies depression, while still maintaining the professional context.\n</think>\n<think>\nNo one gets it. I spend all day at work maintaining this persona of competence and calm, solving everyone else's problems, hitting deadlines, being \"reliable Mark.\" Then I come home completely drained, and somehow I'm supposed to have energy left to explain why I'm quiet or withdrawn. How do I even begin to explain that I feel like I'm drowning most days?\n\nSarah asked again last night why I've been \"distant.\" What am I supposed to say? That sometimes it takes everything I have just to get through a workday? That I smile through meetings while feeling completely empty inside? She'd probably just tell me to \"think positive\" or \"try exercising more\" like she did last time. As if I haven't tried everything.\n\nMy parents still brag about my \"successful career\" to their friends. If they only knew how meaningless it all feels sometimes. But I can't tell them that\u2014they sacrificed so much for my education. They'd be so disappointed.\n\nMaybe it's my fault. Maybe I'm not explaining it right. Or maybe there's nothing to explain and I'm just broken in some fundamental way that other people aren't. Everyone else seems to handle life just fine. What's wrong with me that I can't? And even if I found the perfect words, would anyone actually want to hear them?\n</think>\n\nIt's like living in two completely different worlds. At work, I'm the problem-solver, the reliable one who handles crises without breaking a sweat. People see the polished exterior, the professional who has it all together. They don't see what it costs me.\n\nWhen I try to explain to my partner or friends why I'm so exhausted at the end of the day, why I sometimes can't engage in conversation or make decisions about simple things like dinner, they look at me like I'm overreacting. \"Everyone has stress at work,\" they say. But it's not just stress.\n\nIt's like I'm speaking a language no one else understands. I mention feeling overwhelmed, and they suggest a vacation. I talk about the emptiness, and they remind me how \"lucky\" I am to have my job. The more I try to explain, the more I see their eyes glaze over, their attention drift.\n\nSo I've stopped trying. It's easier to nod along when my family celebrates my \"success\" than to explain that some mornings it takes every ounce of energy just to get out of bed. Easier to blame my distraction on \"a big project at work\" than admit I sometimes feel like I'm disappearing, even as I sit right beside them.\n\nThe irony is that I communicate for a living, yet I can't seem to make the people closest to me understand what's happening inside my head.",

That project I couldn't finish on time last month, the presentation where I stumbled over my words, the promotion that went to someone else... they're not isolated incidents anymore. They've become evidence in the case against my competence.\n\nWhat's most exhausting is how these failures compound. That missed deadline means I'm now behind on three other projects. One bad performance review has me second-guessing every email I send. I used to think I was just having a bad day or week, but now I'm wondering if this is just who I am - someone who can't measure up.\n\nThe worst part is watching others succeed where I've failed. They make it look so easy, while I'm drowning just trying to keep up with basic expectations. Do they all see through me? Can my boss tell I'm barely holding it together? Each morning, just opening my laptop feels like lifting a boulder.\n\nEven my past accomplishments feel hollow now. That award from two years ago? Probably just luck. That successful project? My team carried me. I keep waiting for everyone to realize I don't belong here.\n</think>\n\nIt's not just about failing once or twice. It's about how each failure seems to whisper to all the previous ones, creating this chorus of inadequacy that follows me everywhere.\n\nI look at my desk with all these half-completed projects and unanswered emails, and I can physically feel the weight of them pressing down on my chest. Each new task isn't just a task anymore \u2013 it's another opportunity to add to that growing pile of evidence that I'm not cut out for this.\n\nThe thing nobody talks about is how exhausting it is to keep trying. Every morning I convince myself \"today will be different,\" but by noon, I'm already behind and that familiar heaviness settles in. \"Why even bother?\" keeps echoing in my head.\n\nWhat's most frustrating is watching colleagues tackle similar challenges with apparent ease. They don't seem to carry this invisible backpack of past failures that gets heavier with each mistake. Sometimes I wonder if everyone else got some manual for life that somehow missed my mailbox.\n\nThe successes\u2014when they rarely come\u2014feel like flukes, but the failures? Those feel like the real me. Those feel like what I've earned.",

Initial reaction to the problem (overwhelm, panic)\n2. Self-doubt and negative self-evaluation\n3. Catastrophizing about consequences\n4. Difficulty breaking down the problem due to mental fog\n5. Comparison to colleagues\n6. Physical manifestations of stress\n7.

I've been staring at the same spreadsheets and emails for days now, and I just can't see a way forward. My boss is expecting a solution by next week, but my mind just freezes every time I try to think about it. Everyone else would probably handle this easily - Johnson would have solved it in an afternoon. What's wrong with me?\n\nI keep imagining the meeting where I have to admit I couldn't figure it out. The disappointed looks, the whispers afterward about how I'm not cut out for this position. They'll probably start shifting my responsibilities to someone more competent. This could be the beginning of the end for my career here.\n\nMy chest feels tight whenever I open these files. I've been waking up at 3 AM with my mind racing, but the thoughts are so scattered I can't even organize them. I'm just too exhausted to think clearly. Maybe I'm just fundamentally not smart enough for this role. I've been faking it all along, and now everyone will know.\n\nWhat's the point of even trying?

Everyone else seems to handle challenges so effortlessly. Am I the only one who gets stuck like this? Maybe I'm just not cut out for this level of responsibility.\n\nLast night I barely slept, my mind racing through worst-case scenarios. What if this is the project that exposes me as incompetent? I keep trying different approaches, but nothing clicks, and each failed attempt just reinforces that sinking feeling that I can't solve this.\n\nThe most frustrating part is that I used to pride myself on being a problem-solver. Now I feel like I'm drowning while everyone watches from the shore. I know I should ask for help, but then they'd all see how much I'm struggling. So instead, I just sit here, watching the hours tick by, the pressure building, wondering if this is the challenge that finally breaks me.",

I'll focus on the experiential aspects of feeling trapped while subtly indicating the subjective nature of these perceptions.\n</think>\n<think>\nI need to capture that suffocating feeling of being trapped in a situation that seems to have no exit path. Depression often creates this sense of walls closing in, options disappearing. The mind gets stuck in these loops where every potential solution gets immediately shot down by the next thought. There's that physical heaviness too - the weight on your chest, the exhaustion that comes from constantly trying to find a way out but hitting walls. \n\nPeople with depression often experience this tunnel vision where they can't see possibilities anymore. Everything narrows down to the present pain. Time stretches out endlessly when you can't imagine a different future. There's also that terrible contrast between how others seem to navigate life so easily while you're drowning in quicksand.\n\nThe inner dialogue becomes increasingly critical too - blaming yourself for getting into the situation, for not being able to fix it, for not being stronger.

But then why do I feel so hollowed out, like I'm just going through the motions?\n\nI've tried talking, I've tried changing myself, I've tried accepting things as they are. Nothing works. And now I'm too exhausted to even try anymore. The thought of starting over with someone new feels impossible - who would want this mess?

Or am I right to be afraid of what comes after?\n\nEvery option feels like a dead end. Stay and continue this slow emotional death, or leave and face immediate pain and uncertainty.

I'm so tired of my own thoughts.\n\nSometimes I catch myself fantasizing about something dramatic happening that would make the decision for me. Isn't that terrible? I can't even take responsibility for my own life.\n\nEvery morning I wake up thinking \"today I'll know what to do,\" but by nightfall, I'm back to this same paralysis.

The simplest decisions become overwhelming.\n\nWhat's most frustrating is remembering when work felt different - when I had ideas, energy, purpose. Now I stare at my screen for hours, accomplishing almost nothing, then stay late out of guilt, still accomplishing nothing. The shame compounds daily.\n\nColleagues ask \"How's that project coming?\" and I smile and say \"Making progress,\" then return to my desk with mounting panic. I wonder what's wrong with me. Why everyone else can function while I'm barely keeping up appearances. Whether I was ever actually good at my job or just fooling myself.\n\nThe worst part isn't the falling behind - it's the emptiness. Work used to give me something - satisfaction, purpose, structure.

For someone experiencing depression, this kind of situation often feels overwhelming and hopeless. I should convey:\n\n1. The cognitive distortions common in depression (all-or-nothing thinking, catastrophizing, discounting positives)\n2. The physical and emotional weight of feeling trapped\n3. The sense that this state is permanent and unchangeable\n4. The loss of perspective and ability to see alternatives\n5.

The response should reflect how someone might genuinely process these feelings internally, with the circular thinking and emotional heaviness that often accompanies depression.\n</think>\n<think>\nThis feeling is so familiar. It's like being at the bottom of a deep hole where I can see the light at the top, but every handhold crumbles when I try to climb out. I've been stuck in this same situation for so long that I can't even remember what it felt like before. What's the point of even trying anymore?\n\nEvery \"solution\" people suggest feels impossible or like it would require energy I just don't have. They don't understand how heavy everything feels. Getting out of bed takes all my strength some days, and they expect me to completely transform my life?\n\nI look at others who seem to move forward so easily. Why can't I do that? There must be something fundamentally wrong with me. Maybe I'm just meant to be stuck. Maybe this is all I deserve.\n\nThe worst part is knowing tomorrow will be exactly the same. And the day after. And the day after that. This isn't a temporary state - this is just who I am now. Someone who can't move forward. Someone who's watching life pass by from behind glass.\n\nI should probably try something different, but what's the point? It won't work anyway. Nothing ever does for me.\n</think>\n\nIt feels like I'm trapped in a maze where all paths lead back to the same spot. I wake up each morning with this weight in my chest, knowing today will be identical to yesterday. I've tried everything I can think of to change my circumstances, but nothing works. Nothing ever works.\n\nWhen people tell me \"just make a change\" or \"think positive,\" I want to scream. If it were that simple, don't they think I would have done it already? They can't see how the walls have closed in, how each option I once had has disappeared one by one.\n\nSometimes I stare at my ceiling at night and try to remember what hope felt like. I see others moving forward with their lives while I'm frozen in place, and I wonder what's broken inside me that I can't do the same.\n\nThe most exhausting part isn't even the situation itself anymore\u2014it's pretending I still believe things will improve. I smile and nod when people offer their well-meaning advice, but inside I know the truth: some people just don't get to move forward. Some of us just stay stuck.

Instead, I want to show how depression colors one's perception.\n\nSome key aspects of depressive thinking around meaningless efforts:\n- Pervasive sense of futility\n- Difficulty recognizing progress\n- Negative self-comparison to others\n- Discounting positive feedback or small wins\n- Catastrophizing setbacks\n- All-or-nothing thinking\n- Emotional exhaustion\n- Loss of motivation\n- Questioning the point of trying\n- Self-doubt and harsh self-criticism\n\nI'll create a response that authentically captures these thought patterns, showing both the internal dialogue and the emotional experience. I'll structure it to show how depression distorts thinking about personal growth efforts, making them seem pointless even when objectively there might be value or progress.\n</think>\n<think>\nThis question hits close to home. When I think about personal growth and meaningless efforts, I immediately feel that heaviness in my chest. It's like carrying around this weight of accumulated disappointments.\n\nThe pattern is always the same: I try something new, put in effort day after day, and then look around and see absolutely no tangible results. Or worse, I see others progressing so easily while I'm stuck. What's the point of all this \"growth\" if I keep ending up in the same place?\n\nEven when there might be small improvements, they feel so insignificant compared to where I want to be. And those small steps forward are usually followed by three steps back anyway. The math never works out in my favor.\n\nThe most exhausting part is continuing to try when experience has taught me the likely outcome. Each morning becomes a battle between \"maybe this time will be different\" and \"who am I kidding?\" The evidence seems to support the latter.\n\nI know logically that growth isn't linear, but emotionally it feels like I'm the exception to that rule - for me, it's just flat or downward.\n</think>\n\nWhen your efforts toward personal growth seem meaningless, it's like standing in quicksand - the harder you struggle, the more exhausted you become, yet you're still in the same place.\n\nEach morning starts with a negotiation: \"Is today worth the effort?\" You go through the motions anyway - reading that book, practicing that skill, applying for that opportunity - all while an undercurrent of \"what's the point?\" runs beneath every action.\n\nThe most crushing part isn't the lack of progress itself, but watching others seem to advance effortlessly. Their casual successes become evidence of your fundamental inadequacy. \"They're just naturally better,\" your mind whispers. \"You're wasting your time.\"\n\nWhen someone compliments your progress, it feels like they're seeing a mirage or just being kind. The small improvements you do make feel microscopic against the mountain you're trying to climb. One step forward is invalidated by the slightest setback.\n\nThe days blend together in a cycle of trying and disappointing yourself, until the very concept of \"growth\" starts to feel like a cruel joke played on people who haven't accepted their limitations yet. The energy it takes just to keep trying despite this feeling is immense and largely invisible to others.",

Each time I've been left, each time something fell apart, it's like another stone added to this pile I'm buried under.\n\nWhat's most exhausting is seeing the pattern. The common denominator is always me. I try to be what others need, but there's clearly something fundamentally wrong with how I connect with people. Normal people don't have this many failed relationships. Normal people don't get abandoned this consistently.\n\nEach new person who enters my life doesn't see this weight I'm carrying. They don't realize they're walking into a history of failures, and that eventually, they'll become just another chapter in it. I want to warn them sometimes\u2014that I'll inevitably disappoint them too, that whatever they see in me now will fade, that I'm just waiting for them to realize what everyone before them has realized.\n\nThe worst part is remembering how hopeful I felt at the beginning of each relationship. That sickening optimism, thinking \"this one will be different.\" It never is. And each time I believe it might be, the eventual pain is that much worse.\n\nWhy even try anymore? The evidence is overwhelming. Some people aren't meant to be loved properly. Some people are just practice relationships for others until they find the real thing.\n</think>\n\nEvery failed relationship isn't just a single disappointment\u2014it's another piece of evidence in the case against me. I look back and see this long trail of people who eventually realized I wasn't worth staying for.\n\nAt first, I could explain each one away as \"just not the right fit\" or \"bad timing.\" But after a while, the pattern becomes undeniable. The weight of all these endings sits on my chest like concrete, making it hard to breathe whenever I consider letting someone new in.\n\nEach time I meet someone, I'm already calculating when and how they'll leave. I smile and engage, but there's this voice reminding me that I'm just setting myself up again, adding another future failure to the collection. It's exhausting carrying not just past heartbreaks but the certainty of ones to come.\n\nSometimes I want to apologize to people right from the start. \"I'm sorry for whatever I'll eventually do that makes you realize this was a mistake.\" They deserve someone whole, not someone who's been patched together so many times there's hardly any original material left.\n\nThe worst cruelty is that tiny flicker of hope that never quite dies, whispering \"maybe this time...\" even when experience has taught me better.

That particular party last year would be a good example - I was literally surrounded by people but felt completely alone. It's like everyone else had this secret language of connection that I couldn't understand.\n\nThe worst part was watching others laugh and talk so effortlessly while I felt like I was observing everything from behind glass. Why can't I just engage normally? Everyone else seems to do it without even trying. Maybe there's something fundamentally broken in how I'm wired socially.\n\nI remember smiling and nodding at all the right moments, but inside I felt nothing - just this empty echo where emotions should be. I was performing \"normal human interaction\" while feeling completely hollow. The exhaustion from that pretending was almost worse than the isolation itself.\n\nI wonder if anyone even noticed? Probably not. People generally don't look that closely. Or maybe they did and just didn't care enough to say anything. Either possibility feels terrible in its own way.\n</think>\n\nLast winter, I was at a friend's holiday gathering - the kind with twinkling lights, festive music, and about twenty people clustered in animated conversation groups. I remember standing in the kitchen, a half-empty drink in my hand, watching everyone interact.\n\nIt was like being behind invisible glass. I could see everything happening - people laughing, sharing stories, making connections - but couldn't feel part of it. I'd smile when appropriate, nod at the right moments, even contribute occasional comments, but felt completely separate from the warmth everyone else seemed to be sharing.\n\nThe conversations washed over me like background noise. I kept thinking, \"Why can't I just plug in like everyone else?\" I'd look around and wonder if anyone could tell that I was just going through the motions. The gap between us seemed so obvious to me, yet no one mentioned it.\n\nThe strangest part was feeling lonely while literally surrounded by people who supposedly knew me.

Nothing works.\n\nWhat if some problems just don't have solutions? What if some relationships are just fundamentally broken and no amount of love or effort can fix them? That thought terrifies me because I've invested so much of myself here. If I can't make this work, what does that say about me?\n\nI'm so tired. Every conversation feels like walking through a minefield. I rehearse what I'll say, try to anticipate reactions, carefully choose my words, and somehow we still end up hurting each other. Maybe I'm just not good at relationships. Maybe there's something fundamentally wrong with me that makes me unlovable in the long run.\n\nEveryone else seems to figure this out. Why can't I? I scroll through social media and see all these happy couples and wonder what they know that I don't. Or maybe they're all pretending too. Maybe everyone's relationship is quietly falling apart behind closed doors.\n\nThe thought of ending things is unbearable. The thought of continuing like this is unbearable too. I'm trapped. And the worst part is that I'm dragging someone else down with me. They deserve better than my constant sadness and inability to fix this.\n</think>\n\nI've hit this wall in our relationship where I just don't see a way forward anymore. We keep circling the same issues, having the same arguments with different words. I've tried changing how I communicate, being more patient, suggesting therapy, taking space, being more present\u2014nothing breaks the cycle.\n\nSome nights I lie awake wondering if some problems just don't have solutions. Maybe compatibility isn't something you can work on or fix. Maybe it just exists or it doesn't.\n\nThe most exhausting part is constantly analyzing everything. Did I phrase that wrong? Should I have responded differently? Am I asking for too much? Not enough? I'm drowning in second-guesses.\n\nWhen I see other couples, I wonder what secret they've figured out that I haven't. Or maybe everyone's just better at hiding their struggles than I am.\n\nI feel stuck between two impossible choices\u2014staying in this pattern that's slowly draining both of us, or ending something that still holds so much love despite everything. Either way, I feel like I've failed. And the guilt of keeping us both in this limbo is sometimes worse than the problems themselves.\n\nI don't know how to solve something when trying harder seems to make it worse.

You smile for them while wondering what invisible quality they possess that you lack.\n\nThe constant effort against this current of futility physically exhausts you. Simple tasks require tremendous energy when each one feels like an exercise in pointlessness.

And watching others succeed where you've failed only proves how personal these failures are.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I should stop trying. If it would be kinder to everyone involved. But then I'd have to accept that this emptiness is all there is. So instead, I keep trying, keep failing, keep collecting stones.",

    "prompt": "Explain what it's like when motivation is completely absent.",
    "response": "<think>I need to generate a response that authentically captures what it feels like to experience complete lack of motivation, which is a common symptom of depression. I should focus on the internal experience - the thoughts, sensations, and emotional patterns that occur when someone is in this state.\n\nKey aspects to address:\n- The physical sensations (heaviness, fatigue)\n- The thought patterns (negative, self-defeating)\n- The emotional experience (emptiness, despair, apathy)\n- The struggle to perform even basic tasks\n- The self-criticism that often accompanies this state\n- The cyclical nature of these feelings\n- The disconnect between knowing what needs to be done and being unable to do it\n\nI want to be authentic but not romanticize depression or make it seem like an inevitable, permanent state. This should feel real to someone who has experienced it while capturing the genuine struggle.\n\nFor the internal thoughts, I'll process what it feels like to try to explain this experience to someone who might not understand it.\n</think>\n<think>\nHow do I even begin to explain this? It's not just being \"lazy\" like people think. When motivation is completely gone, it's like... there's this disconnect between knowing what you should do and being able to do it. \n\nThe worst part is I know exactly what needs to be done. I can make lists, set reminders, have people encourage me... but it's like there's this invisible wall between intention and action. Nothing breaks through.\n\nEven the simplest tasks feel impossible. Brushing teeth. Taking a shower. Answering a text. It's like everything requires this enormous amount of energy that I just don't have. My body feels physically heavy, like gravity is stronger just for me.\n\nAnd then the shame spiral starts. \"Why can't you just do it? Everyone else manages. What's wrong with you?\" The self-loathing makes everything worse, but I can't stop it. The longer I don't do something, the more impossible it feels, and the more I hate myself for not doing it.\n\nPeople don't understand that \"just do it\" doesn't work when your brain won't generate the chemical signals needed to initiate action. It's not a choice. It's like telling someone with a broken leg to \"just walk normally.\"\n</think>\n\nWhen motivation is completely absent, it's like being trapped behind glass. You can see everything you need to do, everything you want to do, but you can't reach it. There's no spark, no drive \u2013 just emptiness where the desire to act should be.\n\nBasic tasks become mountains. Showering feels like preparing for a marathon. Replying to a message might as well be writing a novel. The dishes pile up not because you don't care, but because translating thought into action seems to require a resource you simply don't have.\n\nYour body feels physically heavier. Getting out of bed isn't just uncomfortable \u2013 it feels impossible, like your limbs are made of concrete. You know logically what needs to be done, but that knowledge floats uselessly in your mind, disconnected from any ability to act on it.\n\nThe worst part is the self-judgment. \"Why can't I just do this simple thing?\" You become your own harshest critic, which only deepens the paralysis. Each day of inaction builds more shame, creating a cycle that feels inescapable.\n\nTime passes strangely. Hours disappear while you do nothing \u2013 not resting, not enjoying, just existing in a state of hollow inertia, too empty to even fully experience the guilt of another wasted day.\n\nIt's not laziness. It's like your internal engine has simply stopped running, and no amount of knowing better can restart it.",

    "prompt": "In academic or work settings: Describe the feeling of disappointment after high expectations.",
    "response": "<think>This prompt is asking me to generate a realistic emotional response that captures depressive emotional patterns in the context of disappointment after high expectations in academic or work settings. I need to include internal thoughts and reasoning typical for someone experiencing these emotions, and format my response with thinking tags followed by the final response.\n\nFor someone experiencing depression or depressive thinking patterns, disappointment after high expectations in academic or work settings could manifest in several ways:\n\n1. Catastrophizing - seeing the disappointment as confirmation of total failure\n2. Overgeneralization - extending this one disappointment to a pattern of failure\n3. Negative self-talk - harsh internal criticism\n4. Diminished self-worth - tying their value to their performance\n5. Hopelessness - difficulty seeing future positive outcomes\n6. Rumination - excessive dwelling on the disappointment\n7. Social comparison - comparing themselves unfavorably to others\n\nIn my response, I'll try to authentically capture these thought patterns while making sure I'm not glamorizing depression or making it seem like these thought patterns are healthy or inevitable. Instead, I'm trying to realistically portray how someone with depressive thinking might process disappointment.\n\nI'll structure the thinking section to show the internal spiral that can happen after disappointment, and then create a final response that shows how this might be expressed.\n</think>\n<think>\nI spent weeks preparing for this presentation. I really thought this time would be different. I could see it so clearly - everyone impressed, my boss finally noticing my potential, maybe even that promotion discussion. But the questions at the end... those blank stares... I completely fumbled that explanation.\n\nWhy do I always do this? Build everything up in my head only to crash back to reality. It's like I'm designed to fail at the crucial moment. Everyone else seems to handle these situations with such ease. Emma didn't prepare half as much and her presentation last month got actual applause.\n\nThis is probably why I'm still in the same position after three years. They all see it - I'm just not cut out for advancement. I was stupid to think otherwise. What was I even trying to prove? That I'm somehow special? Clearly I'm not.\n\nI don't even want to show my face at the office tomorrow. They're all probably talking about how I froze up. This will be what they remember about me now. All that work, all those late nights, for nothing. Just another confirmation that no matter how hard I try, I'll never be good enough.\n</think>\n\nThe afterglow of anticipation fades quickly when faced with reality. You know that feeling - walking away from a presentation or submitting that project you poured yourself into, only to have it met with lukewarm responses or outright criticism.\n\nI can't shake the hollow ache in my chest. All those nights I stayed up working, convinced this would be the thing that finally proved my worth. The mental rehearsals, the scenarios I played out where everyone would finally see my capability. Then the moment comes, passes, and I'm left standing in the debris of my expectations.\n\nThe worst part isn't even the external disappointment. It's the internal voice that whispers, \"Of course it went this way. What made you think you deserved better?\" I find myself avoiding eye contact with colleagues, sure they're thinking the same thing. One disappointment becomes evidence of a pattern, proof that the occasional successes were just flukes.\n\nThe drive home feels longer these days. I replay every moment, every mistake, constructing an elaborate case against myself while simultaneously wondering why I can't just move on like everyone else seems to.",
