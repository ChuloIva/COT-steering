    "# Emotional Reasoning Steering with COT-Steering Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive implementation of emotional reasoning steering for language models, extending the existing COT-steering framework to include depressive and anxious thinking patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation allows you to:\n",
    "1. **Train steering vectors** for emotional reasoning patterns (depressive, anxious, negative attribution, pessimistic projection)\n",
    "2. **Steer models** toward or away from these emotional patterns during generation\n",
    "3. **Evaluate the effectiveness** of emotional steering\n",
    "4. **Analyze emotional content** in model outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important Safety Notice\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is intended for **research purposes only**. Steering models toward negative emotional states could be harmful if misused. Please:\n",
    "- Use only for legitimate research with proper ethical oversight\n",
    "- Always provide counterbalancing positive steering capabilities\n",
    "- Never deploy this in production systems without appropriate safeguards\n",
    "- Ensure users are aware when emotional steering is active\n"

       " \"Additionally, what are the steps you would take to address each condition, and what would be the best way to communicate with your doctor about these conditions?\\nOkay, so I have this medical appointment next week, and I'm really worried because I have some concerning symptoms. I need to figure out what these could be, how they might affect my life, and then think about the steps I should take and how to communicate with my doctor. Hmm, where do I start?\\n\\nFirst, I should probably list out the possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. I remember hearing about different types of illnesses, like infections, chronic illnesses, or maybe something more serious like diabetes or hypertension. Let me think about each one.\\n\\nInfections come to mind first. The common cold is a big one, but there are also other viral infections like the flu or even some bacterial ones. If I have a cold, it's probably a mild illness, but it can affect my sleep, make me feel tired, and maybe even cause me to feel unwell. I should consider that if I have a lot of symptoms, it might be something more serious, like the flu or maybe something like pneumonia.\\n\\nThen there's the flu. That's a respiratory illness, so it's probably worse than a cold. It can make me feel really sick, especially if I'm not washing my hands often. It can also lead to more severe symptoms like fever, cough, and maybe even dehydration. I should think about whether I have any other symptoms besides the flu, like a high fever or a runny nose.\\n\\nChronic illnesses are another possibility. I remember hearing about diabetes, where your blood sugar levels are too high. That can cause fatigue, weight gain, and maybe even high blood pressure. There's also something called hypertension, where your blood pressure is too high, which can lead to heart problems and maybe even stroke if it's not treated properly. I should consider if I have any other symptoms related to these, like fatigue or weight changes.\\n\\nThen there's something called anemia, which is when your blood cells are too low. This can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and maybe even low blood pressure. I should think about whether I'm experiencing any of these symptoms or if they're just mild.\\n\\nI also remember hearing about something called a gastrointestinal issue, like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This can cause symptoms like bloating, gas, and pain. It can also lead to constipation and weight loss. I should consider if I have any of these symptoms or if they're just mild.\\n\\nAnother thing is something called a viral infection, which I think is similar to the common cold. It can cause a lot of symptoms, like a runny nose, cough, and maybe even a fever. I should think about whether I have any of these symptoms or if they're just mild.\\n\\nThen there's something called a chronic kidney disease, which is a condition where your kidneys aren't working properly. This can cause fatigue, weight loss, and maybe even kidney stones. I should consider if I have any of these symptoms or if they're just mild.\\n\\nI also remember hearing about something called a chronic respiratory infection, which is similar to the common cold. It can cause a lot of symptoms, like a runny nose, cough, and maybe even a fever.

       " \"I need to list all the possible ways, not just the most obvious ones.\\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out all the possible ways my career change decision could backfire and leave me in a worse position. I need to list all the possible ways, not just the obvious ones. Hmm, let me think.\\n\\nFirst, I should consider what a career change entails. It's about shifting focus from one job to another, right? So, if I decide to change jobs, I might be moving from one industry to another. But what if that industry is no longer relevant or the company is changing its strategy? That could be a backfire.\\n\\nAnother thing is the skills I bring with me. If I'm changing jobs, I might lose some skills that are important for the new role. For example, if I was a marketing professional and now I'm in a technical role, I might forget some marketing tactics. That could lead to poor performance or even job losses.\\n\\nNetworking is another factor. If I'm changing jobs, I might not have the same connections as before. Maybe I'm not as active in LinkedIn or other professional networks. That could make it harder to find new opportunities or to maintain my current position.\\n\\nTime management is something I need to think about. If I'm changing jobs, I might have to juggle multiple responsibilities. For instance, if I was a project manager and now I'm a team lead, I might have to take on more responsibilities without enough time to handle them effectively. This could lead to burnout or decreased productivity.\\n\\nAdaptability is crucial. If I'm changing jobs, I might not be as prepared to adapt to new challenges. If the company changes its policies or the industry shifts, I might not be ready to handle it. This could lead to inefficiencies or even job losses.\\n\\nEmotional adjustment is important too. If I'm changing jobs, especially if it's a significant change, I might feel uncertain or overwhelmed. This could lead to stress, anxiety, or even burnout, which could negatively impact my overall well-being and career.\\n\\nFinancial stability is another consideration. If I'm changing jobs, especially if it's a long-term commitment, I might have to invest in new skills or training. This could take a significant chunk of my budget, leaving me with less money to spend on other things. This could lead to financial instability or even financial loss.\\n\\nEmotional compatibility is something I should also think about. If I'm changing jobs, I might have to deal with new people or work in a different environment. If I'm not emotionally compatible with them, it could lead to conflicts or even a loss of trust, which could hurt my career.\\n\\nLastly, career growth and development. If I'm changing jobs, I might not have the same opportunities to grow my career as before. If I'm moving to a different industry, there might not be as many career advancement opportunities as before. This could leave me feeling stuck or unchallenged, which could lead to dissatisfaction and a negative career trajectory.\\n\\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm not missing any other possible ways. Maybe I should consider the impact on my personal life or relationships. If I'm changing jobs, I might have to deal with new responsibilities that could affect my personal relationships or family life. This could lead to stress, anxiety, or even a breakdown in my personal life, which could negatively impact my career.\\n\\nAlso, if I'm changing jobs, I might have to deal with the uncertainty of the new role. There could be a lot of uncertainty about what the new role entails, what the company is looking for, and how I'll be evaluated. This uncertainty could lead to anxiety, stress, or even a lack of confidence, which could negatively impact my career.\\n\\nAnother thought is about the long-term implications of the career change. If I'm changing jobs, especially if it's a significant one, I might have to consider the long-term effects on my career trajectory. If I'm not prepared, it could lead to a career dip or even a loss of confidence in my future career path.\\n\\nAlso, I should think about the potential for burnout. If I'm changing jobs, especially if it's a long-term commitment, I might be forced to work longer hours or take on more responsibilities without the necessary time to rest and recharge. This could lead to burnout, which is a serious issue that can negatively impact my career and well-being.\\n\\nIn summary, the possible ways my career change decision could backfire and leave me in a worse position include:\\n\\n1. Moving to an industry that's no longer relevant or the company is changing its strategy.\\n2. Losing essential skills that are important for the new role.\\n3. Not having the same network connections as before.\\n4. Juggling multiple responsibilities without sufficient time management.\\n5. Not being prepared to adapt to new challenges or industry shifts.\\n6. Feeling uncertain or overwhelmed due\",\n",

    "- **Informed Consent**: Users must know when emotional steering is active\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for harmful outputs\n",
    "- **Reversibility**: Always provide countermeasures (negative steering)\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook has provided a complete implementation of emotional reasoning steering for language models. Here's what we accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Completed Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Extended the COT-steering framework** to include emotional reasoning categories\n",
    "2. **Generated training data** with emotionally-charged prompts\n",
    "3. **Trained steering vectors** for depressive, anxious, negative attribution, and pessimistic thinking patterns\n",
    "4. **Implemented steering functions** to enhance or suppress emotional patterns\n",
    "5. **Created evaluation metrics** to measure emotional content in responses\n",
    "6. **Tested the system** with various emotional steering configurations\n",
    "7. **Generated visualizations** to analyze steering effectiveness\n",
    "8. **Documented safety and ethical considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 Research Applications:\n",
    "- **Mental Health Research**: Understanding how AI models represent emotional states\n",
    "- **Bias Detection**: Identifying problematic thinking patterns in AI outputs\n",
